Chennai Metro's 118.9km phase 2 maps released
",2019-03-02T15:43:38Z,"CHENNAI: Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL) on Saturday officially released maps of its ambitious 118.9km phase-2 project that will connect far-flung suburban areas with the core localities of the city through three corridors.






CMRL has released two maps- one of the 52km corridor - (Madhavaram to CMBT and from Madhavaram to Sholinganallur linking the eastern part of the city including the IT hub at OMR), and the other of the entire phase with three corridors. Construction work for the 52km corridor will begin before the end of this year. It comprises 128 stations.

The three corridors of the phase include Madhavaram to Sipcot, Lighthouse to Poonamallee and Madhavaram to Sholinganallur. The estimated cost of the project is Rs 69,000 crore.

While several changes were made to the alignment and to the names of the stations, one of the corridors initially planned to link localities from Lighthouse to CMBT was later extended up to Poonamallee to link high passenger traffic areas like Porur and Iyyapanthangal.

At present, the soil test is underway for the 52km corridor and a 10km corridor - from Lighthouse to Vadapalani.

Compared to the 45km phase-1, phase-2 will have smaller stations to cut down cost and land required for construction.

Samjhauta Express services restored; Train to run from India on Sunday: Railways
",2019-03-02T11:32:08Z,"NEW DELHI: The Samjhauta Express will leave for Pakistan from Delhi on Sunday after the two neighbours agreed to operationalise services at their ends, a senior railway official told PTI.


The announcement came a day after Pakistan released Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman.

The official said the first train from India will leave on March 3.

While Pakistan had cancelled its services right after an air strike by the Indian Air Force, India cancelled the operations of the Samjhauta Express on February 28.

The Railway Board in an order had said all operations of the Attari Special Express, Delhi-Attari-Delhi, which together with the Pakistani line from Wagah-Lahore is known as the Samjhauta or Friendship Express, will remain cancelled.

It had also said that the cancellation was due to ""purely operational reasons"".

Sources said after the missive about Pakistan's resumption of services was conveyed to the board, it was decided that services on the Indian end will resume too.

The train will start running from the Indian side on Sunday, while on the Pakistan side it will leave Lahore on Monday for its return journey, the official said. 

On the Indian side the train runs from Delhi to Attari and from Lahore to Wagah on the Pakistan side.

The Samjhauta Express, named after the Hindi word for ""agreement"", comprises six sleeper coaches and an AC 3-tier coach.

The train service was started on July 22, 1976 under the Shimla Agreement that settled the 1971 war between the two nations.

From Lahore, the train departs on Monday and Thursday.The train operates from Delhi on every Wednesday and Sunday.

The sources said the footfall on the train, which generally records an occupancy of around 70 per cent, had fallen drastically post the Pulwama terror attack on February 14 carried out by Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed in which 40 CRPF jawans were killed.

Western Railway alert in Maharashtra, Gujarat, MP warns of terror attack
",2019-03-02T06:59:03Z,"MUMBAI: Western Railway (WR) sounded an overall alert and beefed up security at all its stations in Maharashtra, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh after intelligence inputs from Gujarat on the possibility of a deadly terror attack. The inspector general’s (Railway Protection Force) office told security agencies at all WR stations to keep a close watch on long-distance trains, particularly those plying to and from Jammu.


A letter was sent by the IG’s (RPF) office in Churchgate to heads of RPF in Mumbai, Vadodara, Ahmedabad, Ratlam, Rajkot and Bhavnagar on February 22. The letter stated that after the Pulwama attack, intelligence inputs were communicated by state railway police from Gujarat on the possibility of multiple blasts in public places, including railway stations, temples and the iconic Statue of Unity. The inputs stated that the attack would be helmed by a person from Hyderabad, also involved in the Pulwama attack, with allegiance to the Pakistani outfit Jaish-e-Muhammed.




Jaish planning even bigger strike, warn intel inputsEmboldened by its success in the Pulwama suicide bombing, Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) plans to carry out another fidayeen attack of a much bigger magnitude, intelligence intercepts of conversations on February 16-17 between JeM leadership in Pakistan and its terrorists in Kashmir have revealed.


RPF personnel have been instructed to coordinate with other state and local security agencies to maintain tight bandobast. Senior officers said a list of sensitive stations had been circulated to all security agencies.

“In view of the security alert, Western Railway RPF had a co-ordination meeting with Mumbai GRP officers on February 27 and with the GRP commissioner on February 28 to discuss coordinated action required on trains and railway premises. All posts have been alerted and directed to take preventive measures in co-ordination with GRP and city police,” said chief PRO Ravindra Bhakar, WR (RPF).

“Random frisking of commuters and baggage checks are jointly being conducted by RPF and GRP. Personnel have been mobilised in large numbers and are involved in creating awareness and sensitising passengers on Mumbai’s suburban section,” Bhakar added.

With 27 stations, 2 corridors, Agra to have running Metro by 2024
",2019-03-02T05:43:32Z,"AGRA: The Union Cabinet has finally approved the Agra Metro Rail Project which is estimated to cost Rs 8,379.62 crore and is planned to be completed in five years. A total of 27 stations will be completed along 29.4 km of the rail corridor in the city. According to the Agra Development Authority (ADA) officials, the Metro rail project will prove to be a major boost to the urban public transport connectivity in Agra.

The Union Cabinet, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on Friday approved Agra Metro Rail Project having two corridors. These corridors will connect major public nodes, tourist places and city cluster areas of Agra.

Anil Kumar, divisional commissioner of Agra who is also the ADA chairman, said, “Implementation of Metro rail system will result in less vehicular traffic and better movement on the roads leading to reduction in congestion, travel time, cost of journey and pollution. The Metro rail system will also promote transit-oriented development which will lead to development of more residential and commercial complexes along the corridors.”

According to the detailed project report (DRP) approved by the Union Cabinet, the Agra Metro Rail Project will have two corridors which will pass through the heart of the city and will connect prominent tourist places, including the Taj Mahal, Agra Fort and Sikandara as well as ISBT, Raja Ki Mandi railway station, medical college, Agra Cantt railway station, Collectorate, Sanjay Place and densely populated residential areas.

The length of Sikandara to Taj East Gate corridor is proposed to be 14 km, which is partly elevated and partly underground. This corridor would comprise 13 stations (6 elevated and 7 underground ones). The length of the second corridor from Agra Cantt to Kalindi Vihar would be 15.4 km, comprising 14 stations (all elevated).

About 20 lakh population of the city is expected to be benefited by the Metro Rail Project.

Mayor Naveen Jain said, “The residential areas along the rail corridors will be immensely benefited, as the people of these areas will be able to travel on trains from their own neighborhoods to reach different areas of the city conveniently. The Metro will provide eco-friendly and sustainable public transport to residents, commuters, industrial workers, visitors and travelers.”

The Union Cabinet has decided that the ‘Lucknow Metro Rail Corporation’, a 50:50 jointly owned company of government of India and government of Uttar Pradesh will be reconstituted as ‘Uttar Pradesh Metro Rail Corporation (UPMRC)’. It will have all the responsibility for time-bound implementation of Agra Metro Rail Project.

A senior ADA official said, “The Agra Metro Rail Project will be financed by the central and state governments on equal equity basis and partly in the form of soft loans from an international funding agency. The state government has already allocated Rs 175 crore for the financial year 2019-2020.”

The project is expected to put tab on road accidents, pollution, travel time, energy consumption, anti-social incidents as well as regulate urban expansion and land use for sustainable development.

While approving the project, the Cabinet has also stipulated that city bus services in Agra should be strengthened within one year of the approval of the Metro project.

86 buildings along 1.6km stretch to be vacated for East-West tunnelling
",2019-03-02T03:18:34Z,"KOLKATA: Eighty or more unsteady houses along SN Banerjee Road, Nirmal Chandra Street and Raja Subodh Mullick Square may be temporarily evacuated — more than 1,200 will be relocated in the process — in the first phase to facilitate the giant tunnel boring machines (TBMs) to burrow under congested central Kolkata to complete tunnelling of the East-West Metro corridor.


Kolkata Metro Rail Corporation (KMRC), the agency implementing the Howrah Maidan-Sector V link, doesn’t have access to study the condition of all structures identified on the TBMs’ ‘influence zone’. So it undertook a phased building condition survey (BCS). Results of the first BCS, covering 1.6km between SN Banerjee Road and Raja Subodh Mullick Square (where East-West’s ventilation shaft is being built), reveals 84 “very critical to negligibly critical” buildings among the 224 lined up on both sides in the ‘influence zone’. 



Two more weak buildings couldn’t be studied because the owners refused to let KMRC in. The 86 buildings are right on the TBMs’ alignment from SN Banerjee Road to Raja Subodh Mullick Square and must therefore be protected and evacuated.

The most critical of the lot is Futnani Chambers on 6A SN Banerjee Road. Classified “very critical”, it is the sole entrant in this category, being the most hazardous. Not all buildings are really threatening to fall apart, admitted officials, but KMRC is not taking a chance and would like to have most, if not all, structures vacated while the TBMs bore along. So far, a list of 1,234 persons have been prepared for the temporary relocation.

Futnani Chambers alone has more than 150 commercial and residential occupants who will have to stay out of their premises for about a fortnight to allow the west-bound TBM — Chandi — to pass. 

“The tunnelling will take place around 15m-20m below the ground. Most of the shocks will be absorbed. But we are keeping our fingers crossed. We wonder if any TBM has ever traversed such a tricky stretch in India or elsewhere,” said an engineer. 

The TBMs will operate like moving factories as they travel beneath the buildings, and thus create a turbulence that’s negligible if the structures are in good condition. Several of those on SN Banerjee Road and Nirmal Chandra Street are not. Some, like the one on 1A SN Banerjee Road, had been declared “condemned” by Kolkata Municipal Corporation. But the owner has failed to empty and repair the property occupied by three offices. Then there are iconic structures like the Metropolitan Building, the once 20th Century Fox-owned Elite Cinema, and the building where the heritage photography studio Bourne & Shepherd operated from, not to forget BC Ray’s home.

Hi-Tec Metro works to end in 10 days: MD NVS Reddy
",2019-03-02T02:26:56Z,"HYDERABAD: Increasing efforts to make the service available to the public soon, Hyderabad Metro Rail officials inspected the 10-km Ameerpet – Hi-Tec City stretch of Corridor-III on Friday.


The Hyderabad Metro Rail Limited (HMRL) MD NVS Reddy, inspected all the eight stations of the stretch with other senior officers and said that L&T construction organisation would complete all pending works of the metro rail stretch within 10 days.

It was decided that the designer sidewalks or footpaths developed by HMRL on Road No. 36, Jubilee Hills and elsewhere would be protected with bollards to prevent parking of vehicles. Bus bays, auto bays, e-vehicle bays and electric charging facilities would be created at all Metro stations. A two-acre open space at Madhuranagar-Taruni station will be used to hold a temporary ‘Taruni Market’ on the lines of Numaish with about 150 stalls.

Railway minister flags off Ara-Ranchi weekly train
",2019-03-02T02:17:14Z,"PATNA: Railway minister Piyush Goyal on Friday flagged off Ara-Ranchi weekly train (18639/18640) through videoconferencing from Rail Bhavan in New Delhi.


The new train will start its normal run from March 2 via Sasaram route. Union minister of state for energy and Ara MP Raj Kumar Singh was also present at a function held at Ara station to mark the launch of the new train.

Goyal also inaugurated the functioning of the newly installed escalator and a new 20 feet-wide foot over bridge (FOB) at Ara station. He also inaugurated platform improvement work and installation of LED lights at the station.

Goyal said the escalator at Ara station would benefit senior citizens, women and specially-abled passengers.

In another function, Union minister for health and family welfare Ashwani Kumar Choubey inaugurated newly installed escalator and lift at Buxar station on Friday. He also inaugurated a new videoconferencing enquiry system at Buxar station.

Earlier, Choubey inaugurated a rare oil painting of shehnai maestro Ustad Bismillah Khan at Dumraon station, his native place, as a mark of respect for him.

Meanwhile, railways has provided temporary stoppages of Sanghamitra Express at Dildarnagar, Magadh Express at Gahmar and Danapur-Secunderabad Express at Narkhed from Saturday for a period of six months.

First Chinese Metro rake to arrive on February 5
",2019-03-02T01:22:34Z,"KOLKATA: The first rake for Metro Railway from CRRC Dalian Co Ltd in China is expected to arrive within the Kolkata Port Trust (KoPT) jurisdiction by Sunday. The 107.42-metre long MV Han Zhang that left the Shanghai port on February 5 with eight coaches of the state-of-the-art rake stopped at Chittagong and is now on its way to the anchorage at Sandheads, about 223km from Kolkata.


“The Hong Kong-flag vessel is expected to enter the Kolkata Dock System (KDS) of KoPT either on Sunday evening or early on Monday. The ship is carrying the rake weighing 364 tonnes. The coaches will be unloaded by the ship’s own cranes that have a capacity of 200 tonnes,” a KoPT official said.



This is the first time that a rake for the Metro Railway is arriving by sea. In fact, this is the first time that a rake for use in Kolkata is being imported. Officials are eagerly awaiting the arrival of the rakes from China as they would augment capacity and allow Metro to phase out older ones that are well past their operational lives. Metro Railway has ordered 14 rakes from Dalian and one of them is expected to reach Kolkata every month after the arrival of the first one.

“The rakes will use the port’s railway link to enter the Indian Railways system. It will then reach Dum Dum and cross over to the Metro tracks. In the past, rakes manufactured at ICF, Chennai, and elsewhere have been brought to Kolkata by rail. Even the last two rakes from ICF were hauled to Kolkata by locomotives. Rakes for the East-West Metro corridor arrived by road as they are standard gauge ones and can’t run on broad gauge tracks. The rake from China is coming well covered to prevent any damage and these will only be removed at the carshed. The wheels and undercarriages have been left free to allow haulage,” Metro Railway CPRO Indrani Banerjee said.

Unloading the rake will also be a tricky job for port authorities as the coaches will have to be gently lowered on to the railway tracks and then coupled. This is the first time that the port is handling such cargo.

1,240 died in Chennai railway division last year, 70% were crossing tracks
",2019-03-02T00:27:06Z,"CHENNAI: Last year, 2,577 people died on railway tracks in Tamil Nadu and Kerala, latest data from Southern Railway shows. Of this, about 50% of the deaths were recorded in Chennai division, where more than 11 lakh commuters travel on 570-odd suburban services every day.






On Thursday, Birendra Kumar, the chief security commissioner of Southern Railway, who heads the Railway Protection Force (RPF), sent out an internal communication to railway officials flagging the statistic as ‘alarming’, sources said. The additional general manager, P K Mishra, had observed that the state of affairs was worrying and needed immediate course correction, sources said.






“About 70% of the deaths are caused due to trespassing. This can be avoided by devising a strategy,” sources quoted Kumar as stating in the letter.

Statistics show that in Chennai division, the number of deaths increased by around 25% from 2016. Though the numbers have not changed from 2017, it is still a cause for concern as in 2015, the then divisional railway manager (DRM) Anupam Sharma had come out with short, medium and long-term plans to reduce the number of deaths. Data shows that the plans have gone awry, but officials and passengers said carelessness of commuters was equally to blame.

The statistics show that in Chennai division, 70% of commuter deaths were due to jaywalking, which according to Kumar is not under their control.

Joint analyses done by Government Railway Police (GRP), RPF and other railway officials found several reasons. Commuters cross tracks as it is easier than climbing foot over-bridges (FOB) or taking subways. An internal study shows that 35% of trespassing deaths happen at locations where an FOB is provided to cross tracks.

In most cases, those dying are students or young professionals who are either listening to music on earphones or talking on their phones while crossing tracks, an RPF officer said. Youngsters think they can cross a track as an EMU train seems far away. “People should understand that railway tracks are not roads where they can cross when there is no vehicle movement. Here you pay with your life,” he said.

The other reason for jaywalking is the absence of boundary walls separating residential colonies from railway tracks, especially on the peripheries of the city. “The ministry of railways has decided to build 3,000km of boundary walls to address this,” Kumar told TOI.

The 2018 data shows that in Chennai, 96 died and 148 were injured after falling off trains. This was during peak hours when commuters hang perilously from overcrowded coaches. Despite the St Thomas Mount accident in July, railway officials have not done enough to increase the number of services or coaches to reduce congestion, said commuters.

The commissioner of railway safety A K Manoharan in his interim report on the Mount accident case had recommended longitudinal seats in EMUs akin to those in Metro rail coaches, but it would need major design changes as well as bureaucratic will from the railway board, said officials.

K Baskar, member of Chennai Divisional Rail Users Consultative Committee, said passengers should be more aware as their carelessness could kill them. “But railways should construct subways at more stations to curb jaywalking,” he said.
